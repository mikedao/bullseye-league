# NRA Bullseye League - Step-by-Step Implementation Blueprint

## Development Strategy Overview

This blueprint breaks down the implementation of the NRA Bullseye League score tracking application into small, incremental steps following best practices for Ruby on Rails development. Each step builds upon the previous ones, ensuring testability and continuous integration of new features.

### Development Philosophy

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature begins with tests
